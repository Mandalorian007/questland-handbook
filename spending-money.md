# Spending Money
When playing Questland you will probably realize that spending
money is rewarded in Questland (Yeah Gamesture likes profits....)
What I am here to tell you is not how much money to spend, or when
to spend as I feel that is a personal choice, but I can tell you 
how to not waste money.

## What is worth buying in Questland?
In Questland you are primarily focusing your purchases on acquiring
either gems or top up points (to get event rewards). Now let's talk
about what to buy to get these.

### Acquiring Gems
Gems are one of the biggest spending currencies in Questland so you 
are only looking to purchase either the $100 dollar (most expensive option)
when the "value" modifier is 4000%(this will change over time just wait for it)
or the "Best Daily Offer" which has a locked in "value" modifier of 4000%. 
These two purchase options will give you the most gems per dollar spent.
(Similar in other currencies, but I don't know the values)

### Acquiring Top up
This is the exact opposite of acquiring gems.  Rather than going for the 
most expensive offer go for the super cheap $1.99 offer (least expensive option)
because it gives you WAY more top up per dollar. Example: $100 offer gives you 
6000 top up points, while 20 of the least expensive offer gives you the same 
amount of top up, but only costing about $40 which less than half the expense
for the same amount of top up.

## When to spend money
While I won't tell you if you should spend money or how much of it, I will tell
you that you should definitely buy top up and spend gems in increments that 
also proc rewards from the Grand Event's ladders.  This means spend no more than
100K gems per day and buy no more than 6000 top up per day.  Make sure you know the
payout spots on the ladders so you know how much to spend/buy which will keep you 
from wasting money!
