# Farming points against a guild boss
The guild boss is the bread and butter of this event and takes some serious coordination from
your guild to be competitive in this scene. Participation and organization are the pillars
on which your score is reflected.

## Overall strategy
Everyone will receive 198 guild boss tickets during the battle event.  And no matter how many
tickets you spend on a guild boss when it dies you will receive the same reward for killing it.
It's also worth noting that killing a higher level boss will grant you more points up to level 150.
150 is also the level that the guild boss stops getting stronger.

So basically you want to have guild members handle 5-10 levels by themselves pushing the boss to level
150 before starting a joint guild push. When the guild push happens you want to have everyone tag the boss 
(hit it with 2 tickets) and you want a Striker (Someone with passive #2 and multiplier over 100) to kill 
the boss. Typically your strikers will save tickets to ensure they can kill the boss as many times as possible 
since each kill will cost them 6 tickets instead of just 2 to tag it.

You will need a pool between 4 and 6 strikers to successfully push the boss to extremely high
levels with a constant streak of guild members tagging the boss to score immense points for your 
guild. Because guild bosses take a while to kill at this high level it is recommended you have 
2 or more joint pushes with the final push being right at the end of the event.

## Custom Guild boss builds
These builds are not good for standard use, but can help enable some extra guild boss killing 
potential.

### Armour Buster
This build is for bosses that stack huge amounts of armour and it takes a long time for a striker to 
break through that armour. It can also help in red events breaking the armour so your striker doesn't
need to worry about hitting the second instant kill if their multiplier is too low.

NOTE: If it is a blue event make sure you either use blue event orbs or no event orbs.

#### Weapons
- The Sanguiner / Sir Malicious
- Any off hand with Resurrection

#### Talents
- Inner Fire
- Elemental Wisdom
- Elevation

#### Playstyle
You basically want to spam 2 red as much as possible which will burn 5% of the enemy shield 
(10% with intensity) this will also trigger an additional 5% of the enemy shield with your primary 
weapon. You can use 2 blue if there is no 2 red available and as a fallback option 1 white.

NOTE: If it is a blue event make sure you either use blue event orbs or no event orbs.

Perfect storm:
- use 2 red: 10% enemy shield
- use 2 red: 10% enemy shield
- use 2 red: 10% enemy shield (max red intensity)
- Boss kills you and you get resurrected
- use 2 red: 15% enemy shield
- use 2 red: 15% enemy shield
- use 2 red: 15% enemy shield
- Boss kills you permanently

Ignoring your damage you have removed 75% of the enemy's shield.

### The Assassin
This build is perfect for the moment when your striker hits a bad patch of rng and pops up in guild
chat with a sad face :( The Assassin is the perfect build to have on your roster for helping to clear
up any messed up boss kill giving you a nice 15% of the bosses' health margin where a player with 2 
tickets can actually finish the boss off!

#### Weapons
- Any * it's not a bad idea to use a talent + weapon combo to generate more red spirits
- Any off hand with Resurrection

#### Talents
- Assassin's Way
- Any
- Any

#### Playstyle
Spam 1 red and stack up some seriously nasty poison damage on the boss!
