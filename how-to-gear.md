# How to Gear
Getting geared up in Questland can be difficult and confusing with so many different 
options available.  This guide is going to take an extremely opinionated stance on 
what the "correct" way to gear up is.  This methodology is shared consensus by a 
large number of top players which can be confirmed by inspecting the builds from the 
hall of fame.  However, everything is still subjective so feel free to disagree and 
do your own thing if you want to.

## Stat Priorities
This is the foundation for our gearing decision and is strongly opinionated.  I will 
cover most of the methodology below.

- Attack > Magic 
- Health > Defense

Attack + health builds are the foundation of top tier players in Questland and with 
good reason. They destroy content. When optimizing a build we have several use cases 
to consider: Campaign, Arena, and the glorious Battle Event.

### Dealing damage: Attack vs Magic

**Campaign:** The campaign is a royal pain to optimize for because you are expected to 
change builds to clear different levels.  By focusing on the popular builds 
(many of which are great campaign clearers) we can see that almost all of the builds 
are either pure attack or a mix of damage except for "The Tank" which is focused on 
survivability and not speed which isn't good for 3 staring campaign maps.  Overall, 
the subjective "best" build for clearing the campaign with 3 stars is the "The Pax", 
while a bit RNG heavy, is arguably the nest suited for 3 staring the most levels due 
to it's hybrid damage types. Given that the best builds for the campaign are more 
attack based we should prioritize attack over magic for these fights.

**Arena:** The arena is a very interesting place in Questland that has an EXTREMELY narrow 
meta towards the top of the leader board.  This meta is usually a heal trigger weapon 
that stacks a particular color and on defense an offhand that procs a heal when the 
opponent heals. For dealing damage there are 2 different "standard" approaches. Deal 
a ton of physical damage to overcome armour while healing like a mad man (Bloodlust) or
screw the enemies armour completely and focus on hitting their HP while keeping your 
armour high to fend of attack builds (Chilling Cold).  In arena this specialization 
means you can use either attack or magic as long as you decide which approach you want.

**Battle Event:** The battle event is the key focus of Questland's late game as it has 
great rewards for both guilds and individuals. The Battle Events are themed either 
red spirits or blue spirits which alternate each week.  For the red spirit events the 
big boss mechanic is a 1 shot every 14 rounds. For the blue spirit event the boss will 
attack with both regular attacks and magic attacks meaning you need a well rounded defense. 
The blue event you can easily setup a build that will never die (until the max round counter
of 100).  However, the red event actually has a pretty steep dps check of 28 rounds WITH 
your offhand needing to be a resurrection item.  For Battle Events prioritizing attack 
due to the dps check makes the most sense.

### Dealing with staying alive: Health vs Defense
Rather than break down each type of scenario health is actually the obvious choice after
considering the game mechanics.  Defense is the primary stat that gives you armour. Most 
magical attack ignore some or all of your armor and some physical attacks will also ignore 
some of all of your amour.  Meaning defense is a "conditional" protection, but health is 
always protecting you.  In addition to this almost great combo in Questland involves a % hp 
heal which becomes stronger with more health.

**Campaign:** Contains enemies that will bypass armour so health is the best stat.

**Arena:** The most popular arena talent is probably Chilling Cold which bypasses most armour, 
so the winner is also health.

**Battle Event:** This event in the solo player and guild side of things is 100% about 
survivability first (only guild pushing may make some DPS optimizations).  Since surviving 
is the primary issue and most bosses have "nuke" attack which you need to survive the more 
hp you have the more likely you are to be able to live and push your scores higher. Since, 
bosses can have magic damage OR your build may not have armor regen health is always better.

### Stat Conclusion
Attack is USUALLY better than Magic, but health is almost ALWAYS better than defense. 
When looking at gear in Questland it's easy to find gear link bonuses with a 30% attack and 
an orb bonus of 15% health. However, if you look at most good Magic gear you usually find gear 
with a 30% magic bonus and a 15% defense.  This means it is VERY hard to get a solid magic + 
health build, but very easy to get an attack + health build.  This gearing trend also makes 
attack extremely favorable and you will see that a large number of hall of fame players are 
only wearing 30% attack bonus with 15% health bonus gear.

## Orb Equips and Leveling
As a rule of thumb level up and increase potential evenly across all orbs. Ensure that every 
piece of gear you equip is benefiting from the orb bonus, and keep in mind that attack + magic 
orbs will provide the biggest boost to your overall power.

### Optimizing your Orb bonuses.
Based on your gearing priority you typically want to activate an orb bonus using a defense orb. 
This is because defense is the worst stat so as you get new better orbs you want to upgrade 
your Health and Attack/Magic orbs instead of the defense orbs. Based on the same logic if you 
need to chose between health and attack/magic you would chose health because attack/magic is the 
most valuable. 

NOTE: This logic is about future proofing your upgrades if you are interested in maximum hero power 
you might be able to do better by maximizing your equipped orb potential, but I don't recommend it.

## Reforging
Make sure you always super reforge so you don't burn as much reforge powder. Since gear link 
bonuses apply to your reforge stats you typically want to focus your primary stat for a piece 
of gear.  In most cases this means you are reforging for attack and discarding other stats. 
However, because this would be super reforge powder inefficient it's also recommended to 
reforge into health as well since it is the strongest defensive stat and will make it easier 
to win a ton of reforge powder in the Battle Events.  The approximate split I'd recommend is 
60/40 attack to health.  Feel free to adjust this to your liking.

## Collections
The perfect scenario would be every Attack, Magic, and Defense slot has an equipped piece of gear
that has high potential and it's gear link lined up with the equipped slot so you have a 
30% bonus on each of these pieces.  Then you can use the health slots to make sure you 
have all your gear links filled out and hopefully these "filler" pieces in the health slots 
also have high health. In reality this is very hard which is why you see most players stick
to wearing 1-2 different sets to make Collections a bit easier to work out.

Hopefully in the future we will have a tool to "auto-solve" collections for you.


### Reforging collections gear
Technically every piece of collections gear can be reforged to increase your stats even more! 
However, in reality this can be quite expensive so ensure that you have all your core gear 
and weapons reforged before even considering this. Especially since swapping a single 
equipped piece of gear could mean a bunch of collection changes.
