# How to dominate the Battle Event
The battle event is the pinnacle of Questland's end game and encompasses both personal
and guild based goals. Fortunately, you can assist both the guild objectives and your 
own with the following setup and priorities.

## Event gearing
Gearing up for the event is as simple as leveraging either the "Hecatombus" or "The Turtle"
build with some modifications based on your battle multiplier links.

When pushing the ladder you want to setup your event multipliers as follows:

Row 1: Activate Passive Skill #2
Row 2: Insert as many legendary orbs as you have into slots and potentially enhance them to +4 or 5
Row 3: Epic Event token and common event token or a piece of gear with greater than +10 boost
Row 4: Resistance against Physical or Magic depending on the boss.

When pushing the guild boss it's common to swap row 3 and row 4 for damage boosts if the boss
is too weak to 1 shot you or if you are simply tagging the boss.

## Pushing the ladder as a solo
This section of this guide is dedicated to making sure you maximize how high you can push on 
the solo ladder. In order to push as high up on the ladder as you possibly can it means that
you need to bring your battle event multiplier to the absolutely highest possible values you 
can before switching from using 2 tickets on the hard boss. This is because each boss kill gives 
you the same amount of points regardless of how many tickets you use to kill it.  So by simply
using less tickets on the lower level bosses you will have more tickets on the higher level bosses.

While this sounds simple in theory it actually involves quite a bit of work. The real trick is 
leveraging all the crafting bonuses you get towards the end of a battle event. 

Bonuses of note:
- 5 craftable event legendaries + 1 bonus from doing all 5
- 2 x30 tradable parts (swap with guild members so you get 2 and they get 2)
- Event legendary orb craft

In total assuming you are upgrading an epic orb to legendary that is another 12 multiplier
and if you enhance your legendary orb to +4 that can be up to 16 additional multiplier.

Since these craftable event bonuses are so large if you wait before switching to more tickets
you can clear an additional few bosses. Which means you can spend those tickets on more kills of
the higher bosses for extra points.

Overall this idea in theory seems great until you realize that you have limited ticket 
capacity so you can't just wait around forever or you lose tickets. This means you need to 
think about ticket management very carefully.


## Farming points against a guild boss
The guild boss is the bread and butter of this event and takes some serious coordination from
your guild to be competitive in this scene.  Participation and organization are the pillars
on which your score is reflected.

### Overall strategy
Everyone will receive 198 guild boss tickets during the battle event.  And no matter how many
tickets you spend on a guild boss when it dies you will receive the same reward for killing it.
It's also worth noting that killing a higher level boss will grant you more points up to level 150.
150 is also the level that the guild boss stops getting stronger.

So basically you want to have guild members handle 5-10 levels by themselves pushing the boss to level
150 before starting a joint guild push. When the guild push happens you want to have everyone tag the boss 
(hit it with 2 tickets) and you want a Striker (Someone with passive #2 and multiplier over 100) to kill 
the boss. Typically your strikers will save tickets to ensure they can kill the boss as many times as possible 
since each kill will cost them 6 tickets instead of just 2 to tag it.

You will need a pool between 4 and 6 strikers to successfully push the boss to extremely high
levels with a constant streak of guild members tagging the boss to score immense points for your 
guild. Because guild bosses take a while to kill at this high level it is recommended you have 
2 or more joint pushes with the final push being right at the end of the event.
