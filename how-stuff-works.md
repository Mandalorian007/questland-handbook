# How Stuff works

This section of our guide is dedicated to digging into the actual mechanics of various 
things in Questland.

## Orbs
Orbs a special item that can be socketed into one of your equipped pieces of gear for 
additional bonuses. They come in 3 different types: Health, Attack & Magic, and Defense. 
Each orb also has a particular strength associated with it called potential which determines 
how much stronger an orb becomes as you level it up and enhance it's quality.

### Orb level
//TODO confirm mechanics with devs

In general any orb you want to use you will spend the gold to level up to level 100. 
If you are short on gold it is recommended to level all your orbs evenly until you get 
them to 100. Please keep in mind that when you go to replace the orb there is no way 
to recover any gold spent leveling the orbs and it will all be lost. So before switching 
to a new orb make sure you are going to use the orb for a while.

### Orb Quality
// TODO confirm orb mechanics with devs

Don't bother upgrading orb quality until you have decent potential legendary orbs in all 
slots and your orb bonuses working. Raising an orb's quality very quickly gets more expensive 
with each level you upgrade it to.  However, it can quickly provide some powerful bonuses. 
When upgrading it is recommended to first quality your orbs that have a bonus followed up 
with attack and defense orbs, and then everything else to get the most value from your upgrades. 
Just like with leveling your orbs we recommend upgrading them evenly because of the large 
cost increase to upgrade each level.

### Gearing with orbs
//TODO add a link to the "gearing" information explaining how to select your orbs.


## Gear Bonuses
Each pieces of gear comes with 2 different possible bonuses that are something you will 
always want to take advantage of.  You can have a bonus for having certain other pieces of
gear equipped (either on your character or in a collection) and you can have bonuses for
socketing certain orbs in your gear.

### Other equipped gear bonuses
Each piece of gear will have a list of 3 different pieces of gear that can be equipped to 
get an additional 30% of a particular stat. You will only need to equip 2 of 3 pieces of 
the listed gear to activate the bonus.  You won't get anything from having all 3 pieces equipped.
The equipped piece of gear can either be on your character directly or in either of your collections.

### Socket orb bonuses
Every piece of gear will have 2 options for orbs that you can socket to get stat bonus
from your orb.  You will only need to socket 1 of the 2 and socketing more than that 1 
won't do anything for you. It is common practice to prioritize maximizing the stat bonus. 
For instance if you have a %15 orb health bonus, and your piece of gear can socket a 
low potential health orb or a low potential defense orb, then you will want to socket the low
potential defense orb and equip a powerful health orb to get the most out of your bonus.
