# How Stuff works

This section of our guide is dedicated to digging into the actual mechanics of various 
things in Questland.

## Orbs
Orbs a special item that can be socketed into one of your equipped pieces of gear for 
additional bonuses. They come in 3 different types: Health, Attack & Magic, and Defense. 
Each orb also has a particular strength associated with it called potential which determines 
how much stronger an orb becomes as you level it up and enhance it's quality.

### Orb level
In general any orb you want to use you will spend the gold to level up to level 100. 
If you are short on gold it is recommended to level all your orbs evenly until you get 
them to 100. Please keep in mind that when you go to replace the orb there is no way 
to recover any gold spent leveling the orbs and it will all be lost. So before switching 
to a new orb make sure you are going to use the orb for a while.

### Orb Quality
Don't bother upgrading orb quality until you have decent potential legendary orbs in all 
slots and your orb bonuses working. Raising an orb's quality very quickly gets more expensive 
with each level you upgrade it to.  However, it can quickly provide some powerful bonuses. 
When upgrading it is recommended to first quality your orbs that have a bonus followed up 
with attack and defense orbs, and then everything else to get the most value from your upgrades. 
Just like with leveling your orbs we recommend upgrading them evenly because of the large 
cost increase to upgrade each level. It is also worth noting at orbs currently do not have 
an enhancement cap, but due to the cost increasing dramatically with each level, the general 
soft cap most players agree on is around +6.

### Calculating orb bonus
The formula for calculating an orb's bonus is as follows (confirmed December 2019 via support):

(Base orb stat + orb enhancement bonus * potential) * 5% = Enhancement bonus increase
Note: Orb enhancement bonus is the count of the times boosted so a +7 would be a 6 bonus

Example:  Hope Reborn Orb (potential 62) at a +7 enhancement
(192 + 62 * 6) * 5% = 28.2 extra points

//TODO confirm with devs the final calculation for orb overall bonus.

### Gearing with orbs
//TODO add a link to the "gearing" information explaining how to select your orbs.


## Gear Bonuses
Each pieces of gear comes with 2 different possible bonuses that are something you will 
always want to take advantage of.  You can have a bonus for having certain other pieces of
gear equipped (either on your character or in a collection) and you can have bonuses for
socketing certain orbs in your gear.

### Gear links
Each piece of gear will have a list of 3 different pieces of gear that can be equipped to 
get an additional 30% of a particular stat. You will only need to equip 2 of 3 pieces of 
the listed gear to activate the bonus.  You won't get anything from having all 3 pieces equipped.
The equipped piece of gear can either be on your character directly or in either of your collections.

### Socket orb bonuses
Every piece of gear will have 2 options for orbs that you can socket to get stat bonus
from your orb.  You will only need to socket 1 of the 2 and socketing more than that 1 
won't do anything for you. It is common practice to prioritize maximizing the stat bonus. 
For instance if you have a %15 orb health bonus, and your piece of gear can socket a 
low potential health orb or a low potential defense orb, then you will want to socket the low
potential defense orb and equip a powerful health orb to get the most out of your bonus.

More details on this in the "gearing information"

## Collections
Collections are an absolute powerhouse, but a bit complicated so let's break them down 
piece by piece to avoid confusion.  Make sure you have first read about Gear Bonuses before
trying to understand collections.

### Unlocking Collections and leveling collections
Collections will benefit you the most by simply unlocking them before bothering to level them. 
After you have all the slots in a collection unlocked simply level them up evenly till you hit 
220% before focusing on getting a single slot up to level 250% which becomes really hard since 
scrolls have large diminishing returns at this point.

//TODO confirm if VIP level had a cap on collection level

### Collection slot stat
Every collection slot will be focused on a particular stat: health, attack, magic, or defense. 
The goal is to socket high potential items with high values for a given stat into that slot. 
One what to think about this is that the collection is a filter.  It will ignore every stat 
on the socketed piece of gear except for the stat for that slot.

### Gear links in Collections
It is important to note that bonuses from gear links will work, so try to line up your gear 
link bonuses as well (Gear that is equipped OR in either collection can all link with each other).
Increases from gear level will be completely ignored so leave your collection gear at level 1.

Note: Getting an optimized collection is extremely difficult, but can easily afford you a HUGE 
power boost so it is worth the pain.

## Reforging
Don't bother reforging until you have a complete build with fully leveled equips, full gear links, 
all socketed orb bonuses and your orbs enhanced a bit.  Reforge powder disappears fast....

### Reforging Priorities
Reforging can afford you a massive power boost, but you will burn about a million powder to reforge 
all your gear so make sure you really like your gear before starting to reforging everything. 
It is worth noting that any reforge points you apply WILL be affected by your gear link bonus!!! 
This means that it is important to focus your reforge points on that stat for "maximum effect". 

Many strategies will split their reforge points for cost efficiency and other priorities, but more 
on this is the gearing section.
