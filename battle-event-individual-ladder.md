# Climbing the individual ladder in the battle event

Climbing the individual ladder in Questland is a challenge and requires 
both gem investment, proper build management, and at the end of the day some
good rng. While there is no guaranteed path to success it is extremely possible 
to stack the deck in your favor so you can win large amounts of scrolls to 
boost your collections.

## Multipliers and Links
In order to score at the top of the ladder you are going to have to invest some 
gems in order to stack your multiplier up nice and high.  The core behind doing 
this involves a heavy focus on the event legendary items and orbs.  Each of these
items unlocks a powerful +12 multiplier with an additional +1 per boost. 
As opposed to the normal legendary items that grant you a +4 multiplier with a +.1 boost.

In addition to the stronger bonus the event legendary items and orbs provide you get 
some powerful and incredible link bonuses.  The 3 core event legendary items and the 
legendary token unlock passive #2 which gives a 50% chance to proc a 4 white when you 
use either a 4 red or 4 blue depending on the battle event.  Having 3 legendary orbs will
also stack your starting board with 6 additional red or blue spirits so you have way less
wasted rounds building up.

Links are also massively important for dealing with challenging bosses. Some extremely
important bonuses to be aware of:

Row 3: These bonuses are primarily for surviving difficult bosses
- 4% healing per round
- 4% armour per round

It is also important to realize that if your healing and armour is sufficient you should simply
socket your epic token (+7) and your rare token(+5) OR any legendary item with a boost over 10. 
Doing this will increase your health and damage and help to reduce the chance of being 1 shot.

Row 4: This bonus is almost exclusively reserved for damage reduction
- 10% magic resistance
- 10% melee resistance

In most cases these bonuses will be used to reduce the red boss's core damage attack and the blue
bosses's strongest damage attack.

## Acquiring your bonuses

The first thing you want to do is figure out how you plan to acquire 3 legendary gems. Your
main options are the orbs & parts event call (extremely rng heavy), event spinner that is only 
available at the start of the event usually takes around 150 spins to get one of the top 3 spots,
or you can spend 300k gems to get the guaranteed reward.  Unfortunately, the craftable legendary 
orb comes way too late to be useful for the solo ladder, since there is no way to store up 
enough tickets before it becomes available.

If you end up spending 100k or 200k gems you can get 1 or both event legendary items to get your 
bonus going. At this point you are going to also need to craft the legendary token, the 2 craftable
30 part gifts, and the direct 4 crafts for the legendary item with 1 bonus.  The problem, is that
you cannot craft all of these items before can't save anymore tickets and you need to push. You 
have two options here use gems on the event call to get more event legendary items so you won't 
need as many crafts or spend money to purchase as many tokens and gear shards as you can get. If 
you ended up using the event wheel at the start of the event you might have received enough tokens
to reduce this issue.

## Builds

### Blue Spirit Events
For blue spirit events our core build is going to be "The Turtle" as it will help us 
mitigate the heavy physical boss damage with high armor recovery. However, it is worth
calling out that the build doesn't have enough healing to handle the high damage output 
from the main boss. The solution to this is in unlocking passive #2 from the event
multiplier links. This gives us a 50% chance to trigger a 4 white when we use a 4 blue.
By pairing this ability with the Mystical Wind talent we can trigger a heal strong enough
to heal us to maximum health thanks to the boss boosting our magic power. 

### Red Spirit Events
For red spirit events our core build is going to be "The Hecatombus" as it will provide us 
a ton of build in healing and sustain.  In fact with the boss providing a magic boost, 
bloodlust will actually be plenty of healing! However, red spirit bosses have a 14 round
ability that will 1 shot you. In order to combat this your offhand will be swapped out for an 
offhand that has a combat resurrection.  Since we drop your offhand we will lose out on the healing 
from the 1 white trigger, but the 4 white triggers of the Crest Guardian will provide the 
needed red spirits to keep the 4 red spam working and a needed damage boost since there
will be a 28 round kill limit before the 1 shot mechanic triggers a second time.

## Ticket management
The techniques I am about to cover will typically be available for everyone, but you might
not be able to wait for all crafts if you don't have a high enough VIP level.  This is because
you can have a larger amount of both boss and campaign tickets stored up with higher VIP levels
while I don't have any direct data to support this I have heard that you will need a minimum of 
VIP 10 to fully pull off all techniques listed here.  Obviously that varies based on many, 
many factors.

- Do not collect any tickets from your quest rewards as they are free ticket storage
- Do not clear every ticket you have for the campaign because it grants more boss tickets
- Watch your hp for clearing 2 ticket bosses to make sure you won't die so you know how far you can safely push

These above strategies are the trick to keeping your tickets from overflowing. However, there is 
one complication. In order to score as high as possible you also need to be purchasing boss tickets
daily. In a low competition bracket you can skip the green boss tickets, but you definitely need
the red tickets to score very highly. This means you will have extra boss tickets you need to keep
under the cap.  DO NOT purchase the Boss tickets pack unless it is the final day and doing so will 
push you up a scoring bracket with some big rewards. Remember that pack is a once per event so 
definitely don't purchase it early and don't waste gems if it won't win you anything.

In terms of pacing for tickets it is usually save to burn all your campaign and boss tickets 
you get on the first day.

## Boss killing timings
When killing bosses it is absolutely critical to keep track of the %hp you land at after receiving
an attack. The attack you want to track is whichever one is more likely to kill you first. Typically 
this is the secondary more powerful boss attack in blue events and the primary boss attack in red 
events.  If you are in a red event, you won't be regenerating armour so keep in mind you should 
measure from the attack that hits you without armour.  By keeping track of the last 3-4 of these 
numbers you can have a fairly reliable prediction of how dangerous the next level of boss will be
for you and if you can safely handle it or if you need to stop and build your multiplier higher.

### Red event micro gearing adjustments
After boosting your multiplier to the max you are going to reach a point where the next boss level
will out right kill you with it's main attack as soon as you have no armor. At this point we will be 
switching to a 4 ticket kill phase, but there are some tricks that can be done to extend the 2 ticket 
killing as long as you have a very high multiplier (130+). These gearing switch ups will put you into 
a dps race with the boss and an RNG nightmare of spirit spawns, but it can net you a lot of extra 2 
ticket kills and dramatically extend your 4 ticket kill range.

Event Multiplier changes:
- Your 4th link bonus needs to be armour regeneration per round
- Bottom damage reduction bonus should be the bosses' primary attack being reduced.

Weapon changes:
- Swap out the Resurrection offhand to be a 4 red -> 1 white trigger

Talent changes:
- Swap out Crest Guardian for Elevation

All of these changes set us into a an RNG deathlock with the boss by swapping to only regenerating
3 red per round (which is why 3 legendary orb bonus is critical) and boosting our armour regeneration 
so that we can absorb higher boss damage attacks. With good spirit rng, a lack of boss dodging, and
maybe a crit here or there you can blitz the boss down before the instant kill ability triggers.  If
not you scored a 4 ticket kill.

With this technique I have managed a 2 ticket boss kill on level 80 and a 4 ticket boss kill on level
82.  At the time of writing this my hero power is around 1,150,000 and I had an event multiplier bonus
of 154 (158 maxing bonus without link optimization) Pre-Artifacts release.
