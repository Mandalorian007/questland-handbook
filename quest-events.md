# How to Quest Event
Right after the battle event there are always brand new quest
events launched that usually have unattainable rewards.  The 
secret to success here is becoming a hoarder.  Don't use spin 
tokens, arena tickets, orb and gear keys, or auto loot tokens.
Constantly save them and then spend them for your quest events
so you can grab all the previously unreachable rewards.
