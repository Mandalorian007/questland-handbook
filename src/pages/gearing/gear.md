# Gear

## Gear Bonuses
Each piece of gear comes with 2 different possible bonuses which you’ll want. There are bonuses for having specific pieces of gear equipped (either on your character or in a collection) and for equipping certain orbs.

## Gear Links
Each piece of gear lists 3 additional pieces providing a bonus when 2 of the 3 pieces are equipped. Equipping the third piece doesn’t provide an additional bonus. The equipped piece of gear can either be on your character directly or in either of your collections. The bonus adds 30% of a particular stat.

## Socket orb bonuses
Every piece of gear will have 2 options for orbs to socket for a stat bonus. You will only need to socket 1 of the 2, and socketing more than that 1 doesn’t add anything.

Prioritize maximizing the stat bonuses you care about. For instance, if you care about health, and your piece of gear can socket a health orb or defense orb, then you will want to socket the defense orb and equip a powerful health orb so you can keep upgrading your health orbs over time and leave the important defense orb that makes the link work.
