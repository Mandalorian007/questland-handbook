# Collections
Collections are an absolute powerhouse but complicated so let’s break them down. Make sure you’ve read about [gear bonuses](https://www.questland-handbook.com/gearing/gear) before working with collections.

## Unlocking and leveling Collections
Unlocking collection slots is the first step. Don’t bother with leveling any of them until you have all of a collection’s slots unlocked. You’ll then want to level them up evenly to 220% before starting to level a single slot to level 250%. Each scroll used after 250% has an increasingly smaller effect.

## Collection slot stat
Every collection slot will be focused on a particular stat: health, attack, magic, or defense. The goal is to socket high potential items with high values for a given stat into that slot. Imagine that collection is a filter which ignores every stat on the socketed piece of gear except for the stat for that slot.

## Gear links in Collections
It is important to note that bonuses from gear links will work, so try to line up your gear link bonuses as well (Gear that is equipped OR in either collection can all link with each other). Increases from gear level will be completely ignored so leave your collection gear at level 1. Artifacted gear that’s slotted, though, will increase stats.

Note: Getting an optimized collection is extremely difficult, but can easily afford you a HUGE power boost so it is worth the pain.

## Collections recommendations
The perfect scenario would be that every attack, magic, and defense slot that has:

- Equipped gear with high potential
- A gear link that lines up with the equipped slot to provide a 30% bonus on each piece

Then, the health slots provide additional space to fill gear links, ideally with high health stats. In reality, this is very hard which is why most players wear multiple sets to make collections more effective.

Hopefully in the future we will have a tool to "auto-solve" collections for you.
