# Artifacts
Artifacts are an absolutely massive feature in Questland that helps you completely scale your character to whole new heights with each level increasing not only your base stats, but your increase in stats for every level. Currently there are five different levels of artifacts in Questland, commonly abbreviated as A1-A5.

## Artifact recipes
Artifact 1

- 3 copies of the item you want to make A1
- 1 legendary of same emblem
- 4 random legendaries

Artifact 2

- A1 of the item you want to make A2
- copy of the item you want to make A2
- 4 legendaries of same emblem
- 4 random legendaries

Artifact 3

- A2 of the item you want to make A3
- A1 of same emblem
- 2 random A1s

Artifact 4

- A3 of the item you want to make A4
- A1 of same item you want to make A4
- random A3
- 3 random legendaries

Artifact 5

- A4 of the item you want to make A5
- random A4
- 4 legendaries of same emblem
- 4 random legendaries

## What does an artifact give me?
Each tier of an artifact will unlock:

- higher base stats
- higher potential
- additional reforge points

What does awakening do to a piece of gear?

It increases the item level cap by 20 for each artifact level that’s added. An Artifact 1, or A1 for short, has a max level of 120, A2 with 140, A3 with 160, A4 with 180, and A5 with level 200.

## Artifact upgrading considerations
Artifacts are incredibly powerful, but be careful before creating them since there is no way to undo or split the artifact into parts once it’s created.

Artifact level 1 is a perfectly safe upgrade because you can use it, and swap it out later for another piece of gear without issue. Each artifact level 3 needs three level 1 artifacts to create it, with 1 of those A1 artifacts being the same emblem. So you can have tons of artifact level 1s lying around with no downside.

Artifact level 2 I avoid because if you can't get to level 3 easily your legendary investment could be trapped there.

Artifact level 3 is a good investment to make because outdated level 3s are used to make artifact level 4s. Artifact level 4s are also a good investment, because they’re used to create A5s.

Currently, the end of the artifact level is the A5, and the game developers have said that there won’t be additional artifact levels.

### Legendary sacrifices selection logic
When upgrading to Artifacts you need to select pieces to destroy or sacrifice to create the artifact. Keep this in mind as you’re choosing legendary items to sacrifice to create the artifact:

- Select pieces from sets you do not use in your equipment or collections
- Don’t sacrifice duplicates of the item you’re upgrading to an artifact as these will be necessary to raise to the next artifact levels
- Save gear in groups of 3 for creation of future A1s. If you have 5 dragon rings, 2 can be used for sacrifices, but 3 should be saved for a future A1

Save 4 copies

Option 1:

- sacrifice 3 of the 4 to make an A1 and keep 1 copy for a BE multiplier link

Option 2:

- sacrifice all 4 to make an A3 for sacrifices
