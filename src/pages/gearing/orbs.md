# Orbs
Orbs are a special item that can be socketed into one of your equipped pieces of gear for additional bonuses. Like pieces of gear, there are Rare, Epic, and Legendary versions. Orbs have 3 different types: Health, Attack & Magic, and Defense. Each orb also has a particular strength associated with it called potential which determines the total power as you level it up and enhance its quality. It’s the same idea as with gear. An orb with potential 67 won’t provide as much hero power as an orb with potential 74.

## Orb Level
Orbs take gold to level to 100, but if you replace the orb there’s no way to recover the gold spent leveling it. Level orbs evenly until you get them to 100 if you’re short on gold and decide if an orb is going to be used for a long time before you spend on them.

## Orb Quality
Wait to upgrade orb quality, called enhancing, until you have legendary orbs with decent potential and working orb bonuses from linking them with your gear. Raising an orb's quality very quickly gets more expensive with each level you upgrade it to. However, it can quickly provide some powerful bonuses but remember that gold spent on upgrading orbs isn’t refundable.

When enhancing, pick orbs to:

- Support your chosen gear, since gear’s more difficult to replace.
- Link easily – by using attack & defense orbs for gear links, you’ll be able to replace the health orbs with newly released and more powerful orbs more easily without breaking the link bonuses.
- Enhance equally. The cost of a single level of enhancement doubles each time. Instead of having one orb at +4, you could have two +3 orbs.
- Upgrade those orbs with a gear link bonus first and then upgrade attack and defense orbs to get the most value from your upgrades.
- Stay at the player consensus soft cap of +6 upgrades for orbs. Technically, the maximum quality level is 10, but it is too expensive for the cost so most players agree that stopping at +6 is a good cost to performance ratio.

## Calculating Orb Bonus
The formula for calculating an orb's bonus is as follows:

Note: Each level of enhancement brings a 5% bonus to both the base and potential of an orb.

Base orb stat + (base orb stat * enhancement percentage) + (potential + (potential * enhancement percentage)) * level of orb - 1

Example: Hope Reborn Orb (potential 62) at a +7 enhancement at level 100

192 + (192 * .35) + (62 + (62 * .35)) * 99 = 8545.5

## Orb equips and leveling
As a rule of thumb level up and increase potential evenly across all orbs. Ensure that every piece of gear you equip is benefiting from the orb bonus, and keep in mind that attack + magic orbs will provide the biggest boost to your overall power.

## Optimizing your orb bonuses
Based on your gearing priority you typically want to activate an orb bonus using a defense orb. This is because defense is the worst stat on orbs so as you get new better orbs you want to upgrade your health and attack/magic orbs instead of the defense orbs. Based on the same logic, if you need to choose between health and attack/magic, you would choose health because attack/magic is the most valuable.

NOTE: This logic is about future proofing your upgrades. If you are interested in maximum hero power you might be able to do better by maximizing your equipped orb potential, but I don't recommend it.
