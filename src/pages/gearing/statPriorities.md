# Stat Priorities
The foundation of gearing decisions are based on choosing different stats to prioritize. There are many strong opinions on this topic and these are mine. 

There are 4 stats: attack, magic, health, and defense but I choose two to prioritize.

- Attack > Magic
- Health > Defense

Attack + health builds are the foundation of top tier players in Questland and with good reason. They destroy content. When optimizing a build we have several areas to consider: Campaign, Arena, and the glorious Battle Event.

## Dealing Damage: Attack vs. Magic

### Campaign
The campaign is a royal pain to optimize for because you are expected to change builds to clear different levels.

It’s difficult to optimize for the campaign because you’ll need to change builds to clear different levels.

Looking at popular builds, most of which are great for the campaign, we can see that almost all are focused on using attack or a mix of damage and survivability. 

Overall my pick for the “best” campaign-clearing build is the updated version of the Pax build, now called “Faerie Wrath”. While it relies heavily on RNG, it’s great for 3 starring levels because of its hybrid damage types.

With the campaign builds being attack-based, it’s better to prioritize attack over magic for the campaign.

### Arena
The arena is a very interesting place in Questland that has an EXTREMELY narrow meta towards the top of the leaderboard. This meta is usually a heal trigger weapon that stacks a particular color  with an offhand heal that procs when the opponent heals. 

For dealing damage there are 2 different "standard" approaches. 

- Deal a ton of physical damage to overcome armour while healing like a madman (Bloodlust) 
- or screw the enemies armour completely and focus on hitting their HP while keeping your armor high to fend of attack builds (Chilling Cold). 

In arena, this narrow specialization means you can use either attack or magic as long as you decide which approach you want.

### Battle Event
The battle event is the key focus of Questland's endgame featuring great rewards for both guilds and individuals. The Battle Events are themed either red spirits or blue spirits which alternate each week. 

For the red spirit events the big boss mechanic is a 1 shot every 14 rounds. The red event actually has a pretty steep dps check of 28 rounds WITH your offhand needing to be a resurrection item.

For the blue spirit events, the boss alternates between both regular attacks and magic attacks meaning you need a well-rounded defense. The blue event you can easily set up a build that will never die (until the max round counter of 100). 

For Battle Events prioritizing attack due to the dps check makes the most sense.

## Dealing with staying alive: Health vs Defense

### Campaign
Contains enemies that will bypass armour so health is the best stat.

### Arena
The most popular arena talent is probably Chilling Cold which bypasses most armor, so the winner is also health.

### Battle Event
This event in the solo player and guild side of things is 100% about survivability first (only guild pushing may make some DPS optimizations). Since most bosses have a "nuke" attack which you need to survive, the more hp you have the more likely you are to be able to live and push your scores higher. Since, bosses can have magic damage OR your build may not have armor regen, health is always better.

## Stat Conclusion
Attack is USUALLY better than magic, but health is almost ALWAYS better than defense. When looking at gear in Questland it's easy to find gear link bonuses with a 30% attack and an orb bonus of 15% health. However, if you look at most good magic gear you usually find gear with a 30% magic bonus and a 15% defense. This means it is VERY hard to get a solid magic + health build, but very easy to get an attack + health build. This gearing trend also makes attack extremely favorable and you will see that a large number of hall of fame players are only wearing 30% attack bonus with 15% health bonus gear.
