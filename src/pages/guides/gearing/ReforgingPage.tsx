    <h1>Reforging</h1>
    <p>
      Don't bother reforging until you have a complete build with fully leveled
      equips, full gear links, all socketed orb bonuses and your orbs enhanced a
      bit. Reforge powder disappears fast....
    </p>

    <h3>Reforging Priorities</h3>
    <p>
      Reforging can afford you a massive power boost, but you will burn about a
      million powder to reforge all your gear so make sure you really like your
      gear before starting to reforging everything. It is worth noting that any
      reforge points you apply WILL be affected by your gear link bonus!!! This
      means that it is important to focus your reforge points on that stat for
      "maximum effect".
      <br />
      <br />
      Many strategies will split their reforge points for cost efficiency and
      other priorities, but more on this is the gearing section.
    </p>

    <h3>Reforging recommendations</h3>
    <p>
      Make sure you always super reforge so you don't burn as much reforge
      powder. Since gear link bonuses apply to your reforge stats you typically
      want to focus your primary stat for a piece of gear. In most cases this
      means you are reforging for attack and discarding other stats. However,
      because this would be super reforge powder inefficient it's also
      recommended to reforge into health as well since it is the strongest
      defensive stat and will make it easier to win a ton of reforge powder in
      the Battle Events. The approximate split I'd recommend is 60/40 health to
      attack. Feel free to adjust this to your liking.
