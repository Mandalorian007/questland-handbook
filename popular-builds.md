# Popular builds
This section is dedicated to covering the popular and meta builds in Questland and is a
great starting place for new players who simply need to know a good build to get started.

## Hecatombus
This is the defacto go to build for anyone focusing on attack and offers and impressive 
level of healing and damage.

### Weapons
- Hecatombus
- Azazel Shield

### Talents
- Bloodlust
- Transcendental Tornado
- Crest Guardian

### Playstyle
Hit 1 white or 1 blue to trigger a heal which will add 2 red to your board from 
Hecatombus.  Repeat this until you have one or more 4 red available.  Use 4 red 
which will deal damage and heal you as well as trigger a heal and damage boost from 
Azazel which procs the 1 white.  Since you heal twice it will trigger Hecatombus 
twice and add 4 red to your board ensuring you will replenish or gain red spirits to
continue comboing.

## The Turtle
This build is the exact opposite of the Hectacombus build and focuses on magic damage
first.  It's referred to as the turtle because it regenerates a large amount of armor and
some health every turn making it extremely difficult to kill.

### Weapons
- The Hulk
- Depth of Despair

### Talents
- Inner Fire
- Chilling Cold
- Magic Thief

### Playstyle
Hit 1 red to trigger a heal which will add 2 blue to your board and generate 1 blue 
intensity. When you have 3 blue intensity instead of hitting 1 red switch to 1 white to 
potentially generate 4 blue instead of just 2.  Once you have one or more 4 blue available,
Continuously use 4 blue which will generate significant armour regen.  This will also 
trigger Depth of Despair to proc 1 red which will heal you and keep your blue intensity 
high.  Since this build doesn't recover a full 4 blue you can go back to hitting 1 white 
if you have 3 intensity or 1 red if you don't to recover additional blue spirits.

## Ratchet Rush
This build is the old attack king build before Hecatombus was released.  It is ideal 
for situations where you need to avoid healing, but still need a strong damage output.

### Weapons
- Ratchet Hatchet
- Azazel Shield

### Talents
- Inner Fire
- Faerie Flame
- Elevation

### Playstyle
This build has a slower start than Hecatombus, but it works by spamming 1 blue or 
1 white until you have 4 red available.  Once you have 4 red available spam 4 red as 
often as possible.  When you use 4 red you will add 1 red to the board and trigger 
1 blue and 1 white from Ratchet Hachet and Azazels which additionally gives you armour 
and 2 more reds on the board.

## The Pax
This build is famous for it's insanely high RNG based damage and it's ability to clear 
almost any level in the campaign when RNG is in your favor.

### Weapons
- The Pax
- Depth of Despair

### Talents
- Fist of Frenzy
- Faerie Flame
- Magic Thief

### Playstyle
This build is extremely heavy on chance based triggers, but when everything triggers 
it can pull some insane dps, but the healing is very unreliable and there is no armor
recovery. You open the build with spamming 1 white to generate blue spirits until you 
have 4 blue available. Then you spam 4 blue as often as possible which will grant you
blue intensity and when your blue intensity builds up you have a change to trigger 2 red
which can heal you and grant 1 blue to the board.  Since both Pax and Depth of Despair
are equipped both a 1 white and 1 red will be triggered. 1 red will grant you an additional
1 blue to the board.  The 1 white will grant you 1-2 blue to the board and when your 
intensity reaches level 3 you will also have a high chance at an additional 1 red triggering.
