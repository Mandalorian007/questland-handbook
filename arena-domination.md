# Dominating in the arena
Questland's arena can at first be extremely intimidating, but it's
actually incredibly easy to blast through to the top of the ladder
by leveraging some powerful arena builds.

# Offensive arena setup
Winning on attack is as simple as starting to leverage the core
"The Turtle" build listed over in popular builds. In addition to 
this look to avoid any of the defensive builds listed below and 
you will rocket up the ladder.

# Defensive arena setup
Defensive arena setup is really a just a mirror of looking at the
most powerful offensive builds in the game. Almost all of them 
leverage healing for spirit generation and consistent damage output.

## The Meta Defense
Basically equip any shield that has "when opponent heals trigger 2 white"
Then leverage Sacred Rage or White Witchcraft as a backup. Equip the rest
of either "Hectacombus" or "The Turtle" from the popular builds. The entire
meta is basically just punish healing while enabling your own dps.  This 
defensive setup will make anyone lower geared, or a bit above your gear 
level significantly hesitate before engaging you and have a dramatically 
lower chance of winning.
